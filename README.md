# LiveData

This is a simple service that implements an interface with 4 functions corresponding to the requeirements. I am assuming that:
- We are not going to create Game objects outside of our board. 
- We can still play around with Game objects after them being removed (hence the test cases with non existing objects).
- We don't need validation in a sense that we block negative or impossibly high numbers as scores.
